# ü§ñ Gesture Controlled Robot ü§ñ
My project is a robot controlled by gestures from a bluetooth-connected gauntlet, that moves based on specific movements and directions, such as rotation and forward and backwards movement. One challenge I had was soldering the the pins so that some of them were connected (like the USB port) and some of them were seperate (like the pins on the LED display boards). My biggest takeaway from the project was to solder more carefully and precisely when the pins are pushed fully through, and to bend the pins to keep the pins fully pushed through.

For my first milestone, I have created the main body of the machine, creating the backbone for bluetooth connection. All motors work in coordination with the code inputted into the Arduino, being transported into an L298N Motor Controller. All of this is being powered by a battery case with an On/Off switch. One challenge I ran into was providing enough power for the motors to run. As a result, I used my computer to power the motors when testing, and plan to substitute and test my battery, case, and wiring for further ease of use.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

For my starter project, I built a handy arcade box with four directional buttons, two side buttons with additional game settings including a firing function for specific games, stop start and pause, and a toggle for music. Also, a score counter and game display are all used neatly with LED display, and a switch and battery case are used to power the arcade machine.
