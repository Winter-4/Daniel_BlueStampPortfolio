# ü§ñ Gesture Controlled Robot ü§ñ
My project is a robot controlled by gestures from a bluetooth-connected gauntlet, that moves based on specific movements and directions, such as rotation and forward and backwards movement. One challenge I had was soldering the the pins so that some of them were connected (like the USB port) and some of them were seperate (like the pins on the LED display boards). My biggest takeaway from the project was to solder more carefully and precisely when the pins are pushed fully through, and to bend the pins to keep the pins fully pushed through.

# Final Milestone: 6/24/24

For my third milestone, I attached the top frame to the body of the robot, added a switch to the body, fixed the power disrepencies in the wheels, and started the concept for my glove. My bigget challenge at BSE was resolving an issue regarding an inconsistency in power: by focusing on specific areas that could be problematic, I removed the possibility for error in the motor and energy by changing the battery and constantly checking the voltage. Another issue was pairng to Arduinos together via HC-05 bluetooth modules, and we fixed that by troubleshooting very rigorously. Key topics I have learned in this process include soldering, isolating issues in an engineering process, and how voltage and current function using Ohm's Law. I hope to learn how to analyze code and interpret it into hardware-based actions. 



# Second Milestone: 6/20/24

For my second milestone, I implemented a bluetooth module that is paired with the main body to take inputs and translate them into motor actions. The bluetooth takes inputs from the accelerometer and gyroscope, being processed by the Arduino Nano R3 on the master module. Then, the information is transferred (via Bluetooth) into the "slave" bluetooth module in order to be processed by an Arduino UNO and then outputted by an L298 motor controller with DC motors. What has surprised me the most was comprehensibility of the input process on the hand-mounted bluetooth module, where the data is printed in the Arduino IDE module. A previous challenge I overcame was the bluetooth connection process: it was surprisingly complex and took a long time to troubleshoot through. Before completing the final milestone, I will fix the consistency of power outage within the motors, as well as fix the battery output so that I do not have to use the power of my computer to power the motors. 

# First Milestone: 6/18/24

For my first milestone, I have created the main body of the machine, creating the backbone for bluetooth connection. All motors work in coordination with the code inputted into the Arduino, being transported into an L298N Motor Controller. All of this is being powered by a battery case with an On/Off switch. One challenge I ran into was providing enough power for the motors to run. As a result, I used my computer to power the motors when testing, and plan to substitute and test my battery, case, and wiring for further ease of use.

For my starter project, I built a handy arcade box with four directional buttons, two side buttons with additional game settings including a firing function for specific games, stop start and pause, and a toggle for music. Also, a score counter and game display are all used neatly with LED display, and a switch and battery case are used to power the arcade machine.
