# ü§ñ Gesture Controlled Robot ü§ñ
My project is a robot controlled by gestures from a bluetooth-connected gauntlet, that moves based on specific movements and directions, such as rotation and forward and backwards movement ü¶æ

# Starter Milestone

For my starter project, I built a handy arcade box with four directional buttons, two side buttons with additional game settings including a firing function for specific games, stop start and pause, and a toggle for music. Also, a score counter and game display are all used neatly with LED display, and a switch and battery case are used to power the arcade machine.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
